One-Time Password (OTP) Authentication Script

This Python script demonstrates a simple implementation of One-Time Password (OTP) authentication using the pyotp library. OTP is commonly used as a second factor authentication method to enhance security beyond just username and password.
Requirements

    Python 3.x
    pyotp library (pip install pyotp)

Usage

    Setup:
        Ensure Python 3.x is installed on your system.
        Install the pyotp library using pip if not already installed:

    pip install pyotp

Configuration:

    Modify the users dictionary in the script to include your users' information. This is a dummy database for demonstration purposes. In a real application, you would replace this with a secure database.

Running the Script:

    Execute the script using Python:

        python otp_authentication.py

        Follow the prompts to enter username, password, and OTP for authentication.

Script Details

    Functions:
        login(username, password): Authenticates the user based on username and password.
        generate_otp(username): Generates a new OTP for the user.
        verify_otp(username, otp): Verifies the OTP entered by the user.

    OTP Generation: Uses pyotp.TOTP to generate and verify time-based OTPs.

    Security: This script uses a simulated database (users dictionary) to store user information. In a production environment, use a secure database and ensure secure handling of OTP secrets.

    Demo: The script includes a main function that prompts the user for username, password, and OTP, and performs authentication based on the entered credentials.
